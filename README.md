# EconDataverse Governance, Roadmap & Funding

The EconDataverse grew out of a collaboration between three open-source developers—Teal Emery (Teal Insights), Christoph Scheuch (Tidy Intelligence), and Christopher Smith (Promptly Technologies)—who wanted to create packages that simplify working with economic data, enabling analysts and researchers to spend less time on data acquisition and cleaning, and more time on meaningful analysis.

While much economic data is accessible through public APIs, many sources are only available in static formats such as spreadsheets or reports, requiring manual downloading or scraping. The landscape of economic data tools is also highly fragmented, leading to inefficiencies due to varying designs, syntax, and usability. The EconDataverse addresses these challenges by creating a standardized, cross-language framework with consistent function names, tidy data outputs, and multi-language compatibility.

## Governance

The EconDataverse is currently an informal collaboration involving Tidy Intelligence, Teal Insights, Promptly Technologies, and the ONE Campaign, with Christoph Scheuch as the project lead. Details about our governance are transparently documented in this repository as we further develop the structure.

Decisions are currently made by discussion and consensus among Teal, Christoph, and Christopher. All significant discussions and decisions will be documented openly in this repository.

## Funding

We have received external funding from:

* [2025 ISC Grant by the R Consortium](https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-consortium-awards-first-round-of-2025-isc-grants/): \$6,600 (see the grant proposal [here](https://christophscheuch.github.io/isc-proposal-econdataverse/)). Christoph Scheuch is responsible for ensuring these funds are used to fulfill the grant's objectives.

## Roadmap

Our immediate roadmap through the end of September 2025, aligned with the objectives of the ISC Grant, can be viewed [here](https://github.com/orgs/econdataverse/projects/1/views/1).

## Value Proposition

EconDataverse packages are developed using rigorous software engineering best practices such as comprehensive unit testing, code styling, continuous integration, and high-quality documentation. Our goal is for these packages to serve as durable and reliable building blocks that users can confidently integrate into automated reporting workflows and web applications. Like plumbing in your home, effective data infrastructure should function seamlessly and reliably behind the scenes. Poorly built tools lead to disruptions and inefficiencies, while well-built ones empower smooth and dependable workflows.

By creating robust data infrastructure, EconDataverse packages address critical binding constraints that impede effective policy action:

1. **Time Constraint:** Economic analysts frequently spend substantial time cleaning, preparing, and integrating data—tasks that are essential yet repetitive. EconDataverse packages reliably deliver data in clean, consistent formats, freeing valuable analyst time for more complex and impactful policy analyses.

2. **Financial Constraint:** Commercial data aggregation tools can cost \$20,000 or more per site license per year. EconDataverse provides a free, high-quality alternative, enabling organizations to allocate resources toward deeper analytical insights rather than costly data subscriptions.

Already, EconDataverse packages serve as essential data plumbing in web applications that empower policymakers to make data-informed decisions without needing to code or even be aware of EconDataverse’s existence. This robust foundation unlocks capacity for analysts to focus more deeply on insightful analysis, ultimately enhancing evidence-based policy action.

## Next Steps

* Develop a slightly more formalized governance structure to provide clarity and stability.
* Establish an Advisory Committee to bring strategic guidance and accountability.
* Consider forming a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity in the medium term to attract and manage larger grants.

## Contributor Guidelines and Community

We aim to publish clear contributor guidelines soon to encourage more community involvement. While research shows many open-source projects rely heavily on a small core team, we recognize that building a broader community is valuable for sustainability. With thoughtful development and ongoing upkeep, we aim to offer a sustainable public good that empowers impactful analysis and applications.

We appreciate your patience and support as we develop these structures and welcome community involvement at every step.
